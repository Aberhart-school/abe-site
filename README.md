abe-site: The New WAHS Website
==============================
The new website for William Aberhart High School. The latest, official version of the website can be found at www.aberhart.ca.

Important Notes for Developers
==============================
* Please set your tab indentation level to four spaces, and use actual spaces instead of tab characters for compatibility reasons.
* **PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENT NAMED *CODING FOR THE WEBSITE***. Seriously, it's there so that you don't screw up colossally. Read it.
* The website cannot be run simply by opening and viewing the index page, index.htm (or any other page for that matter); it must be hosted at the top level of a server. Otherwise, hyperlinks to other pages, images, etc., will not work.

The new website of William Aberhart high school

When editing this code, please set your indent to tabs with a width of 4, for compatibility

Also READ THE DOCUMENT CALLED "CODING FOR THE WEBSITE". Seriously. It's there so that you don't screw up colossally. Read it.

Note: you can't run the website just by double-clicking the html file. it has to be hosted on the top level of a server,
otherwise the links and the loading of seperate files don't work

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			
			<h3>How is the website organised?</h3>
			<p>
				The website is organised to mimic school structure. At the top,
				you'll find many different master categories. These will lead
				you to their own area. On the left hand side of each area you
				will find the area menu, which will list all of the different
				subsections within the area. Below that are temporary notifications
				(if any), the CBE RSS feed and links to social media.
				Please note that the left side will change depending on the area.
				</br>
				On the right side, you'll find external links. These remain constant
				throughout the website and include helpful links for everyone.
				You'll also find information on the crisis help line, copyright
				info, as well as temporary links from the CBE.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Where can I find important dates, information, and news?</h3>
			<p>
				News, information and dates for school wide events can be found
				on the front page under "What's New", "Ongoing", and "Upcoming".
				These will be updated regularly as we receive information.
				Highlights of school achievements and important school information
				will be displayed in the slider.
				</br>
				Information for specific clubs, options, and programs can be
				found in their respective sections and are updated as we receive
				information. Many dates are also listed in our Google Calendar,
				which can be downloaded to your preferred device.
			</p>
			
			<h3>How do I reset my CBE Gmail account password?</h3>
			<p>
				The CBE password reset tool is listed under external links on the right side. ->
			<p>
			
			<h3>What's different from the old website?</h3>
			<p>
				The new website is largely the same as the old website. Links are
				usually in the same place, and if not are now listed under the appropriate category.
				The layout has not changed drastically, most things have only been
				reorganised. Links that did not work on the old website have either
				been fixed or removed if they were no longer relevant. We now have
				a search box on the main page to improve efficiency. PDFs and
				documents now open in iframes instead of different tabs, and that's
				about it! If you have any feedback, please check out our survey,
				accessible from the front page.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Where can I find old events and dates?</h3>
			<p>
				Old dates can be found in our calendars or in our news archive,
				both found in the area menu on the left. <-
			
			<h3>Why is the colour scheme a mix of orange and sky blue?</h3>
			<p>
				We are bound by strict colour standards set by the CBE, which means
				that we have to think within the box in terms of colours.
				We do try our best to keep the website looking spiffy though, and
				we're open to suggestions so feel free to let us know what you think.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Who's behind the website?</h3>
			<p>
				The website was developed by students and is maintained by students
				and staff according to guidelines set out on
				<a href="https://github.com/thirstyice/">github</a>.
				The user interface is constantly evolve to provide to you the
				best experience possible, but due to the amount of content and the
				fact that this is done on a volunteer basis, please be patient with any bugs.
				Together we do our best to keep everything up to date and as
				user-friendly as possible.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Where can I find information on schedules for music and school events?</h3>
			<p>
				Information on most schedules throughout the school can be found
				in the calendars listed in the area menu on the left side on the main page.
				These are updated regularly and are not maintained by the website
				team, but rather by the event organisers.
			</p>
			
			<h3>I can't find information I need. What can I do?</h3>
			<p>
				As you probably noticed, we integrated a search bar recently on
				the front page of this website. For anything that you may need,
				we suggest that you use the aforementioned search bar, as we have
				optimised it to only search our website using the familiarity of google.
			</p>
			
			<h3>I can't see any content within the iframe</h3>
			<p>
				If you are experiencing problems viewing the PDF forms, then it
				is likely due to your browser being out-of-date. Current versions
				of all major browsers do support iframes (though, as much as we
				wish we could, we can't take responsibility for all of internet
				explorer's quirks). The recommended browser for this website, and
				in general for most modern websites, is
				<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.
				However, if you are not able to update your browser, we have
				included an
				<a href="/b829/aberhart/main/document-index.html">Index of Documents</a>
				link on the home page content menu, which will allow you find all
				PDF documents on the site and open them up directly.
			</p>

			<h3>PDFs within iframes are out of date</h3>
			<p>
				We do our best to keep everything up to date, and therefore our
				documents are updated as soon as we recieve new copies.
				If, however, there is a new version of a file that is not displaying
				on your computer, please attempt one of the shortcuts listed
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache">here</a>
				according to your browser type as your browser may be mistakenly
				'remembering' an old file for your convenience.

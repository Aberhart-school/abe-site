				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				
				<h3>How is the website organised?</h3>
				<p>
					The website is organised to mimic school structure. At the top, you'll find many different master categories. 
					These will lead you to their own area. On the left there's the area menu, which will list all of the different subsections within the 	area, and below that are notifications and the CBE RSS feed.
					The left side will change depending on the area. </br>
					On the right side, you'll find external links. These remain constant throughout the website and include helpful links for everyone. You'll also find links to our social media accounts and information on the crisis help line.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Where can I find important dates, information, and news?</h3>
				<p>
					News, information and dates for school wide events can be found on the front page under "What's New", "Ongoing", and "Upcoming".
					These will be updated regularly as we receive information. 
					Highlights of school achievements and important school information will be displayed in the slider. </br>
					Information for specific clubs, options, and programs can be found in their respective sections and are updated as we receive information. Many dates are also listed in our Google Calendar, which can be downloaded to your preferred device. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>How do I reset my CBE Gmail account password?</h3>
				<p>
					The CBE password reset tool is listed under external links on the right side. ->
				<p>
				
				<h3>What's different from the old website?</h3>
				<p>
					The new website is largely the same as the old website. Links are usually in the same place, and if not are listed under the appropriate category.
					The layout has not changed drastically, most things have only been reorganised. 
					Links that did not work on the old website have either been fixed or removed if they were no longer relevant. 
					PDFs and documents now open in iframes instead of different tabs, and that's about it! If you have any feedback, please check out our survey, accessible from the front page.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Where can I find old events and dates?</h3>
				<p>
					Old dates can be found in our calendars or in our news archive, both found in the area menu on the left.<-
				
				<h3>Why is the colour scheme a mix of orange and sky blue?</h3>
				<p>
					We are bound by strict colour standards set by the CBE, which means that we have to think within the box in terms of colours. 
					We do try our best to keep the website looking spiffy though, and we're open to suggestions so feel free to let us know what you think.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Who's behind the website?</h3>
				<p>
					The website was developed by students and is maintained by students and staff. 
					Together we try our best to keep everything up to date and as user-friendly as possible.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Where can I find information on schedules for music and school events?</h3>
				<p>
					Information on most schedules throughout the school can be found in the calendars listed in the area menu on the left side on the main page. 
					These are updated regularly and are not maintained by the website team, but rather by the event organisers.
				</p>
				
				<h3>I can't find information I need. What can I do?</h3>
				<p>
					As you probably noticed, we integrated a search bar recently on the front page of this website. 
					For anything that you may need, we suggest that you use that, as we have optimised it to only search our website using the familiarity of google.
				</p>
				
                		<h3>I can't see any content within the iFrame</h3>
                		<p>
                		    	If you are experiencing problems viewing the PDF forms, then it is likely due to your browser being out-of-date. Current versions of all major browsers do support iframes (though, as much as we wish we could, we can't take responsibility for all of internet explorer's quirks). 
                		    	The recommended browser for this website, and in general for most modern websites, is <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. 
                		    	However, if you are not able to update your browser, we have included an <a href="/b829/aberhart/main/document-index.html">Index of Documents</a> link on the home page content menu, which will allow you find all PDF documents on the site and open them up directly.

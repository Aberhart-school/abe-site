					<h1>Transportation Changes for June 2014</h1>
                    <p>
                    For students from Citadel and Ranchlands who use the Calgary Transit express buses to William Aberhart, please note that these buses will only run in the mornings to bring students to school for exam writing.  There will be no direct buses in the afternoons picking up students at Aberhart.
					</p>
                    <p>June 10th is the last day of classes and buses will be here for a noon dismissal.
					</p>
                    <p>
                    ACCESS and ALP classes will have  transportation service until June 20th.
                    </p>

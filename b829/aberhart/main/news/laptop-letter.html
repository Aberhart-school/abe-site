				<h3>Laptop purchase opportunity - Parent info</h3>
				<p>The CBE has been working with PC Corp and OSI, our PC and Apple vendors, to create a high
				value purchase opportunity for CBE students. This unprecedented opportunity offers families the
				opportunity to purchase either a Mac or PC laptop complete with a selection of significant
				educational programs such as Read and Write Gold, Comic Life and Smart Notebook. The laptop
				and associated programs are available at very competitive prices. Should you choose to take
				advantage of this opportunity, please note that this sale takes place with either PC Corp or OSI
				and not through the Calgary Board of Education. For further information regarding prices,
				application selection and ordering, please visit PC Corp or OSI at the following websites:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.pccorp.com/">PC Corp</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.officesolutionsinc.ca/OSI/index.html">OSI</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Microsoft office</h3>
				<p>Additionally, for those families who already have a computer, please be aware of an opportunity
				to purchase Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) for $27.50. This offer is only
				available through a special download site provided to the CBE by Microsoft. Your child can
				download a copy of Microsoft Office Student Professional and will be entitled to all future
				versions while a CBE student. When your child leaves the CBE, he or she retains the perpetual
				license for the software. Please visit <a href="http://www.cbe.onthehub.com">this link</a> if you are interested in ordering.

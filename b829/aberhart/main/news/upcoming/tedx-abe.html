					Many of you have heard of TED talks and the various topics and ideas brought forth by the speakers. We are fortunate to have an independently organized 
					TEDx talk right here at Aberhart on May 9th. The talk will feature speakers and performers from our diverse group of current Aberhart students, as well as
					Aberhart alumni. The goal of TEDxYouth@ William Aberhart High School is to open the doors to new ideas and important conversations, and highlight, as the TED official organization slogan states, the
					"ideas worth spreading" to the students at Aberhart. The theme of TEDxYouth@ William Aberhart High School is 'Moving Forward' and as teenagers looking towards work, business, art, music, university
					or even just adulthood, that's a pretty big deal. Looking at the future can be incredibly frustrating but we're always moving forward regardless of the tasks
					set in front of us. Mankind has achieved incredible things, looking at history we can see the immense change that has taken place in the past hundred years and
					things are hardly slowing down. Even so, we're here, a whole generation to our name. How will we move forward, with science, social issues, economic challenges,
					political climates, or the environment? The world is a daunting place, on an even more daunting scale but together, with thoughts, ideas and each other it will
					always move forward. So, we as students of Aberhart, a small part of a global community, what can we do? If you are interested in helping organize the TEDxYouth@AberhartHighSchool,
					please visit Ms MacDonald (Room 329) or Mr Moquin (Room 202).

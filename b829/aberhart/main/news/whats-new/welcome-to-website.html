					<h2>Welcome to Aberhart's Website!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our website has undergone an upgrade in order to improve navigation, to allow more
                        student-developed content online, and to conform to CBE standards. Most of the
                        development was done by ABE students!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Navigation is still done through the top navigation bar and then the side content menu
                        One significant change is how we display PDF forms. They are now shown using an iFrame,
                        which allows you to browse the document without leaving our website. To download or print a document from an iFrame, click the Tools icon (">>") in the upper right corner of the iFrame.
                   	</p>
                    <p>
                    	If you are experiencing problems viewing the PDF forms, then it is likely due to your browser being out-of-date. Current versions of all major browsers do support iFrames. The recommended browser for this website, and in general for most modern websites, is <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>. However, if you are not able to update your browser, we have included an <a href="/b829/aberhart/main/document-index.html">Index of Documents</a> link on the home page content menu, which will allow you find all PDF documents on the site and open them up directly.
                   	</p>
                    <p>
                         
                   	</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our old website has been archived and is no longer publicly visible. If there is
                        content that you cannot find on the new website, please send us a note! Also, if you have any thoughts or ideas for this website, please let us know by sending an

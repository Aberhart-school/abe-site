				<h2>Scolarships</h2>
				<p>There are many hundreds of thousands more scholarships in existence and all of them have a specific type of student in mind. Within these hundreds of thousands of scholarships there are thousands of different criteria that determine scholarship eligibility (for example, there is a scholarship for the children of Calgary Public School teachers. There is also a scholarship for people who enjoy sailing. And so on).</p>
				<p>These facts have two important implications:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You probably qualify for some scholarships, no matter what kind of scholar you are (as long as you are actually passing!).</li>
					<li>You don’t have time to look at all the scholarships that exist to find out which ones you do and don’t qualify for.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>So, you should look, but you need to be smart about it. Use the links on the left under "Scolarships" to get started</p>

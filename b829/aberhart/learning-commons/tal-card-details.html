			<h2>The Alberta Library Card</h2>
			<h3>
				Did you know that high school students can use post-secondary
				libraries, and sign out their materials, for FREE?
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Albertan adults and students, who are members of any Alberta
					public library or post-secondary institution, are eligible to
					apply for a special library card called a
					<a href="http://www.thealbertalibrary.ab.ca/services/talcard.html">TAL Card</a>.
					TAL is short for The Alberta Library.
				</li>
				<li>
					Having a TAL Card allows you to take out books at over 290
					member libraries in Alberta including SAIT, MRU, ACAD, Airdrie
					Public Library, Edmonton Public Library, etc!
				</li>
				<li>
					A high school student, 17 or younger, can become a member of
					the Calgary Public Library for reduced cost. Students 18 and
					over would have an adult membership. A TAL Card can then be
					requested, free of charge, from any branch of the Calgary
					Public Library. A parent/guardian signature will be required
					on the TAL application for those under 18 years old.
				</li>
				<li>
					Users of a TAL card  must show photo ID when signing out
					materials from other libraries. There is a five item limit
					on TAL loans.
				</li>
				<li>
					Items borrowed can be returned to any member library. For
					example: If an item is borrowed from the University of
					Calgary, it can be returned to any Calgary Public Library
					and the Calgary Public Library will ship it to the U of C.

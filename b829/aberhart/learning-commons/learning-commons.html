				<p>Please keep the noise level down and respect your fellow  students. Clean up your area before you leave and push in chairs.</p>
				<p>The Silent Learning Area: Many who come to the library need a quiet place to study. Please respect the needs of your fellow learners and choose a different area if you wish to talk.</p>

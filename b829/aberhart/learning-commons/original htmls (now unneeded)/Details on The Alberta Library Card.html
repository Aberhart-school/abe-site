<ul>
  <li>Albertan adults and students, who are members of any Alberta public library or post-secondary institution, are eligible to apply for a special library card called a <a href="http://www.thealbertalibrary.ab.ca/services/talcard.html">TAL Card</a>. TAL is short for The Alberta Library.</li>
  <li>Having a TAL Card allows you to take out books at over 290 member libraries in Alberta including SAIT, MRU, ACAD, Airdrie Public Library, Edmonton Public Library, etc! </li>
  <li>A high school student, 17 or younger, can become a member of the Calgary Public Library for reduced cost. Students 18 and over would have an adult membership. A TAL Card can then be requested, free of charge, from any branch of the Calgary Public Library. A parent/guardian signature will be required on the TAL application for those under 18 years old.</li>
  <li>Users of a TAL card  must show photo ID when signing out materials from other libraries. There is a five item limit on TAL loans.</li>
  <li>Items borrowed can be returned to any member library. For example: If an item is borrowed from the University of Calgary, it can be returned to any Calgary Public Library and the Calgary Public Library will ship it to the U of C.</li>

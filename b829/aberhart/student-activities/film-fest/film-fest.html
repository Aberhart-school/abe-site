				<p>
					The Abe Film Fest is an opportunity for students to 
					showcase their movie-making talents by granting them a
					platform to create a 6 minute movie.
				</p>
				<img src="film-fest-projector.jpg" style="width:240px;float:right"/>
				<p>
					The festival begins with daily screenings of the film entries 
					and ends with a Gala Event, held in the gym, where prizes
					are awarded to the winning films and to all participating directors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interested students submit their films in various genres
					such as animation, Claymation, documentaries,
					action, comedy and drama related movies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the past years, our producers have gained experience
					and received high recognition for their talents at other
					film festivals as well as our own.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are the only high school that has managed to keep their Film Fest alive and well
					for so many years; This is because of students
					like you: those of you who are willing to continue supporting our cause, take risks and keep
					the ideas flowing! Go Abe! Go Orange!

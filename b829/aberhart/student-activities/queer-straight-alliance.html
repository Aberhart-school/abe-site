					Queer Straight Alliance
				</h2>
				<p>
					ABEâ€™s Queer-Straight Alliance was launched 8 years ago, making it one of the first of its kind in Calgary.
					It was created to provide a safe, welcoming space for students who identify as queer, are questioning their
					sexual identity, or who simply wish to show support for their fellow students.
					The QSA discusses everything from queer history to feminism to current events,
					and activities can include everything from movie nights, to guest speakers, to dance parties, to Secret Santa.
					With consistently high turnout at meetings and discussions the QSA is a friendly and exciting environment for all students,
					especially for those who belong to a gender or sexual minority.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meetings are every Wednesday at lunch in room 319 (the CALM room),
					and you can always count on there being cookies, plenty of warm, smiling faces, and a place just for you,
					so feel free to drop in any time!

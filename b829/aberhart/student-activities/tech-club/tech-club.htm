					Aberhart's Technology Club
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Abe Tech club is finally here! Finally the technology-savy kids of the school to create a resource for everyone. 
					We're happy to help with whatever tech related woes come up, and so, we introduce to you our submission forms.
					Please click on the links below to be redirected to a form where you can get in contact with us in the fastest way possible. 
					We ask that stage tech requests be submitted at least 1 week before the event or earlier if the event is large.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="computer-support-googleform.htm">Computer Support Requests</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to contact us directly or for any reason other than those covered by the forms, please shoot us an email at 
					<a href="mailto:technologyclub.abe@gmail.com?Subject=Tech%20Support" target="_top">technologyclub.abe@gmail.com</a>
					and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
				<p>
					*Donations are gratefully accepted in the form of food or otherwise
				</p>
				<p>
					For those interested in participating, we hold casual meetings on Mondays during lunch in room 310. 
					We welcome all people from any technology field, such as Stage tech, Photography, Programming, Hardware, Software (i.e. AutoCad, Photoshop, Premiere),
					as well as anyone who wishes to learn!
					We make an active effort to pair those who want to learn with somebody who has experience at the earliest possible opportunity.
					We will also be holding workshops throughout the year on different aspects of technology, like helpful tips for your calculator,
					so keep your eyes peeled for posters near our job board.
					And if you didn't hear from that last line, the Technology Club has a job board too! 
					It can be found outside room 310, and jobs posted there are open to applications from anyone in the school community.
					A separate stream of jobs will be offered to members only.
					If you still have questions, please talk to Tim, Tauran or Nathan for more details.

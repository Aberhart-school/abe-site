Coding for the website
===
The top area is for headers and navigating between areas of the site.

The left area is for navigating within an area of a website; For instance, clicking on the topmenu link to "Departments"
would take you to the main Departments page, then you would be able to navigate different sections/courses using the
left menu. You would return to the main Departments page by clicking the top menu item, which sould be orange.
This area will be different for each area of the website,and will follow a template

The left area also includes the rss feed

The content area is for content. if you are loading a pdf document use the pdf importer outlined in the
pdf-import-template.html.

The right area is for external links. i.e. links to the main cbe website, d2l, homelogic, etc. There will also be a link
to the crisis help page and links to social media. ALL EXTERNAL LINKS GO HERE OR IN CONTENT, NOT IN THE OTHER MENUS.
(if you must put them somewhere else, mark them with the label “(External)”

The footer is for the short copyright info, with a link to the full explanation, along with the cbe slogan.

When you drastically change a file, you can add your name to the copyright header of that file

The standard orange is #f28726; the standard dark grey is #666, the standars cyan is #00adda.

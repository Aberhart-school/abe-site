Coding for the website
===
The top area is for headers and navigating between areas of the site. For most purposes, the only reason you should have to edit it is to add a link to a new document.

The left area is for navigating within an area of a website; For instance, clicking on the top menu link to "Mathematics" would take you to the main Mathematics page,
Then you would be able to navigate different math sections/courses using the left menu. You would return to the main Math page by clicking the top menu item, which
sould be gray

The left area also includes social media buttons, and possibly a generated quote.

The content area is for content. if you are loading a pdf document, a webpage that doesn't include the navigation menus, or similar items, it should be embeded in an
iframe, or something similar

The right area is for external links. i.e. links to the main cbe website, d2l, homelogic, etc. There will also be a link to the crisis help page.

The footer is for the short copyright info, with a link to the full explanation, and the adress.

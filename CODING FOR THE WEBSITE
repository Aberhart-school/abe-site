Coding for the website
===
The top area is for headers and navigating between areas of the site. For most purposes, the only reason you should have to
edit it is to add a link to a new document, or remove a link to an irrevelant document.

The left area is for navigating within an area of a website; For instance, clicking on the topmenu link to "Mathematics"
would take you to the main Mathematics page, then you would be able to navigate different math sections/courses using the
left menu. You would return to the main Math page by clicking the top menu item, which sould be dark gray.
This area will be different for each area of the website,and will follow a template

The left area also includes the rss feed

The content area is for content. if you are loading a pdf document, a webpage that doesn't include the navigation menus,
or similar items, it should be embeded in an iframe, not loaded in a new window.

The right area is for external links. i.e. links to the main cbe website, d2l, homelogic, etc. There will also be a link
to the crisis help page and links to social media. ALL EXTERNAL LINKS GO HERE OR IN CONTENT, NOT IN THE OTHER MENUS.(if you must put them somewhere else, mark them with the label “(External)”

The footer is for the short copyright info, with a link to the full explanation, and the physical school adress.

When you drastically change a file, you can add your name to the copyright header of that file
